GET VS POST

GET 
- Used to retrieve information
- Data is sent via query string
- Information is plainly visible in the URL!
- Limited amount of data can be sent

POST
- Used to post data to the server
- Used to write/create/update
- Data is sent via request body, not a query string!
- Can send any sort of data (JSON!)

INTRO TO REST   -> REPRESENTATIONAL STATE TRANSFER
REST is an "architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems". Yikes. 
It's basically a set of guidelines for how a client + server should communicate and perform CRUD operations on a given resource.

The main idea of REST is treating data on the server-side as resources that can be CRUDed. 
The most common way of approaching REST is in formatting the URLs and HTTP verbs in your applications.
