What is Node?
Until recently, we could only run JavaScript code in a web browser. 
Node is a JavaScript runtime that executes code outside of the browser.

WHAT DO PEOPLE BUILD WITH IT?
Web Servers
Command Line Tools
Native Apps (VS Code is a Node app!)
Video Games
Drone Software
A Whole Lot More!

*The javascript console in our browser is a REPL -> I can type some code in, it will read it, evaluate it, and then print
*window and document does not work if type node in bash, because node will run out of the server.

*We can type node firstScript.js in Git Bash to run the code in terminal
