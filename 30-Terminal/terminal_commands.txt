* The terminal takes some getting used to, but it can be MUCH faster than using a GUI.

---TERMINAL---
A TEXT-BASED INTERFACE TO YOUR COMPUTER. ORIGINALLY A PHYSICAL OBJECT, BUT NOW WE USE SOFTWARE TERMINALS

---SHELL---
THE PROGRAM RUNNING ON THE TERMINAL.

ANALOGY!
TERMINAL -> In this stupid analogy, the ATM is the terminal
SHELL -> The software running on the ATM is the shell

---BASH---
ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR SHELLS (AND THE DEFAULT ON A MAC)

---COMMANDS---
ls -> lists all folders in the directory
pwd -> tells us which directory we are now


---Changing directories---
cd OneDrive -> Now I am in the OneDrive
cd Masa端st端 -> Now I am in the Desktop
cd OneDrive/Masa端st端 -> directly two level or more
cd ../../OneDrive    -> takes me two step back and then one step forward
cd ..       -> One directory back

---Making Directories---
mkdir foldername      -> makes a new directory
mkdir Frogs/TreeFrogs SugarGliders   -> Frogs and SugarGliders added to the Pets directory
TreeFrogs added to the Frogs directory


---Man Pages and Flags---
mkdir -v Cows Horses Rats   -> all of them will be created
ls -l                       -> lists with information like creation time of folder etc.
ls -a                       -> shows all folders including hidden folders
ls -la                      -> both of them


---TOUCH---
mkdir Dogs              -> creates the folder Dogs
touch index.html app.css app.js     -> 3 folders in Dogs        (remember to put the file extension)
** if we again touch app.js for example, and then ls -l         -> change the time file created

---REMOVE---
rm app.css index.html     -> removes it from Dogs when we are in the Dogs directory

rmdir Dogs                -> if the Dogs directory is empty; it will remove it, otherwise; it won't remove it.
rm -rf Dogs               -> it will force to remove Dogs whatever it has files inside of it or not. (rf stands for recursive force)
