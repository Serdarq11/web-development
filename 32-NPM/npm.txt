NPM is reaaly two things!
1. A library of thousands of packages published by other developers that we can use for free! 
2. A command line tool to easily install and manage those packages in our Node projects.

npm i -g        _> stands for global packages (-g)

  "dependencies": {     // when we install it, they came here (example of Artster / index.js)
    "colors": "^1.4.0",
    "figlet": "^1.8.2"
  }


npm install     -> install all dependencies

There was an issue about the last video!!
