What is Express?
Express is our first framework! It is a fast, unopinionated, 
minimalist web framework for Node.js. Express helps us build web applications and APIs efficiently. 
It’s essentially just an NPM package that provides a collection of methods and optional plugins, 
allowing developers to quickly set up servers, define routes, handle requests and responses, and extend functionality as needed. 
Its simplicity and flexibility make it a popular choice for creating both small and large-scale web apps.

EXPRESS HELPS US...
*Start up a server to listen for incoming requests
*Parse incoming requests to access request data
*Match those requests to particular routes defined in the app
*Craft the HTTP response and send the associated content back to the client

LIBRARIES VS FRAMEWORKS

LIBRARY:
When you use a library, you are in charge! You control the flow of the application code and decide when and where to use the library. 
The library provides helpful tools or functions, but it doesn’t dictate the overall structure of your program.

FRAMEWORK:
With frameworks, that control is inverted. The framework is in charge, and you are merely a participant. 
It defines the structure and flow of the application and tells you where to plug in your code. 
You follow its rules and guidelines to build your app.



by npm init -y, we installed the package.json file.
by npm i express, we installed node modules and package lock.json files

app.get(/(.*)/, (req, res) => {
